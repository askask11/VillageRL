                As you can see from the first image, the students were highly concentrated in a small area waiting in line. This line would have been much longer since I came out very late while telling the RA about my coronavirus concerns. This would have been a serious health risk due to the fact that so many people were forced to be in a small area.
                The second image shows a "required" meeting. Which just annouced things that can be completed express within a email but greatly increased the risk.

                            A loud environment is hard for a student to concentrate and study,
                            especially when people become aggressive and rude when you try to stop them.
                            Also, there is little studying atmosphere in the dorm,
                            it interrupts other students to study.
                            It can give one pressure and affect their grade.
                            The school put 8 persons in a room, and in most of the rooms, people scream and game.
                            When people game, they get really excited and cannot control their volumn.
                            Also people run and play basketball in the corridor.

                            It is much easier to get a detention in the res life than in high school. In the res life,
                            you get detention for coming back to dorm late, and in the morning if you are late to get out
                            of the dorm for even one minute. If those late 3 times you get a detention. Also, if your room is
                            not clean enough you get detention either. But in highschool you have to get 3 referrals to get a detention.
                            And RL detention is at 6 am and you will be waken up at 5, very hard and makes people tired.
